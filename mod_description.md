This mod adds a new hero the Candlemaker. She focuses on manipulating light to empower her party.

## Candlemaker

The Candlemaker is a middling support unit that can set up strong turns of powerful healing or devastating damage. In order to maximize her potential, you have to take advantage of her main mechanic: manipulating the light level.

### Wild and Poised

Every one of the Candlemaker's abilities does two things: changes the light level (up or down) and gives one of two buffs. Abilities that increase light give a damage buff when the light is below 51, and abilities that decrease light increase healing received when the light is above 51.

#### Wild (Damage Buff)

- Active when: below 51 light
- Caused by: Candlemaker abilities that increase light
- Duration: 2 rounds
- Effects: -10% minimum damage + 30% maximum damage, stacks

The comforting light of the Candlemaker's party support abilities raises their spirits and their fear of the dark. The light dropping below 51 after one of these abilities will cause them to go wild. Decreasing their minimum damage by 10% per stack, but increasing their maximum damage by 30%.

#### Poised (Healing Buff)

- Active when: Above 51 light
- Caused by: Candlemaker abilities that decrease light
- Duration: 3 rounds
- Effects: +25% healing received, stacks

The brutality of the Candlemaker's damage and debuff abilities make the party yearn for a return to the brilliance of the light. The light rising above 49 will cause the party to bask in the promise of safety. Increasing their healing received by 25% per stack.

### Abilities

#### Snuff (Defensive Buff)

- Stealth target hero for 2 turns (not usable on yourself)
- Clear mark from the target
- Decrease light by a very large amount
- Increases dodge slightly
- Give 2 stacks of Poised to the party

The Candlemaker completely snuffs out of the light of her candle plunging the party into darkness, but also concealing them.

Snuff is an effective way to get your hero out of harm's way. Stealthed units cannot be directly targetted. Be warned: using this ability will drastically decrease your light level, allowing you to take advantage of stacks of Wild your party has but increases your risk of damage and stress.

#### Boogeymen (Offensive Buff)

- Horrify target hero (3 stress per round / 3 rounds)
- Push target forward 1 rank (can be resisted)
- Increase target's damage by 80%-100% for 1 turn
- Decrease light
- Granted 1 stack of Poised to the party

"The darkness holds more much that mere trickery, and boogeymen". The Candlemaker uses the light of her candle to cast horrifying shadows sending a party member into a frenzy.

Boogeymen is best used to set up a huge damage turn for your team. Try using it with collect bounty + mark, shadow fade, or stacks of Wild to rain massive damage into the enemy ranks. Beware: this ability can quickly stress out your units if you aren't prepared for it.

#### Embers (Attack / Debuff) (In Development)

- Small damage to enemy units
- Causes enemies hit to take increased damage for 2 rounds, does not stack
- Decreases Light
- 50%-70% chance to apply Poised on each successful hit

The Candlemaker snips the wick sending insidious embers into the enemy ranks.

Embers is one of only 2 direct attacks that Candlemaker has. The debuff it applies is useful for maximizing the effects of Boogeymen and stacks of Wild. Although it has a low hit chance, each unit hit applies a stack of Poised allow you to set up for a massive healing turn if it hits multiple targets.

#### Eerie Wax (Support Attack) (In Development)

- Small Damage to 1 target
- Transfer bleeds / blights from the target to the Candlemaker
- 100% - 180% increased damage vs bleeding
- 5% - 15% increased crit chance vs bleeding
- 100% - 180% increased damage vs blighted
- 5% - 15% increased crit chance vs blighted
- Decrease torch by a small amount
- Applies one stack of Poised to the pary

The Candlemaker splashes the enemy with wax from her strange candle. The boiling liquid raveonously consume blood and blight alike to devasting effect.

Eerie wax is one of two base attacks for the candlemaker. You'll find it to be fairly weak on its own, however its can be used for massive damage on bleeding or blighted enemies. Especially if they have both. Beware: the candlemaker will get any bleed or blights currently on the target. Try to maximize the effect and minimize the risk by using eerie wax on targets with small damage over times on them.

#### Strike Match (Single Target Heal)

- Heals for 1 damage
- Applies a heal over time for 1-4 damage over 3 rounds
- Increases light
- Grants 1 stack of Wild to the party

"The match is struck". The Candlemaker strikes a match spurning the candle and providing comfort to a member of the party.

Strike match is the workhorse of Candlemaker's healing. The heals are effective but take time to do their healing. Make sure to heal proactively and take advantage of Poised stacks to make it even stronger.

#### Blazing Star (Party Heal)

- Heals target for a small amount
- Heal the entire party over time for 2 rounds
- Greatly increases light
- Disable Candlemaker healing for 2 rounds
- Grants 2 stacks of Wild to the party

"A blazing star is born". The Candlemaker fans the flames of the candle making it roar out of control inspiring the team to great heights.

Blazing star is a "big moment" heal. Healing the entire party over time when you have many stacks of Poised can turn an entire fight around. Beware: using Blazing star will lock the Candlemaker out of healing for 2 rounds so make sure you'll be able to survive without it or utilize your other units to help heal.

#### Mere Trickery (Single Target Support Buff) (In Development)

- Reduces stress from horror by 100% (5 rounds)
- Allows target to ignore stealth (2 rounds)
- 50% increased damage against stealthed targets (2 rounds)
- Small accuracy increase

"The darkness holds much more than mere trickery". The Candlemaker raises her candle high filling the party with comfort and dispelling all the but the most frightening of horrors.

Mere trickery is a way to get mitigate stealth. Not only does it allow a unit to ignore stealth, but increases their damage against stealthed targets. Since enemies with stealth tend to be hard to hit the accuracy increase synergizes well. The stress reduction from horror is very situational but can be great when used with Boogeymen or for specific events like Shieldbreaker nightmares.
