This mod adds a new hero the Candlemaker. She focuses on manipulating light to empower her party.

## Candlemaker

The Candlemaker is a middling support unit that can set up strong turns of powerful healing or devastating damage. In order to maximize her potential you have to take advantage of her main mechanic: manipulating the light level.

### Wild and Poised

Every one of the Candlemaker's abilities does two things: changes the light level (up or down) and gives one of two buffs. Abilities that increase light give a damage buff when the light is below 51, and abilities that decrease light increase healing received when the light is above 51.

#### Wild (Damage Buff)

- Active when: below 51 light
- Caused by: Candlemaker abilities that increase light
- Duration: 2 rounds
- Effects: -10% minimum damage + 30% maximum damage, stacks

The comforting light of the Candlemaker's party support abilities raises their spirits, and their fear of the dark. The light dropping below 51 after one of these abilities will cause them to go wild. Decreasing their minimum damage by 10% per stack, but increasing their maximum damage by 30%.

#### Poised (Healing Buff)

- Active when: Above 51 light
- Caused by: Candlemaker abilities that decrease light
- Duration: 3 rounds
- Effects: +25% healing received, stacks

The brutality of the Candlemaker's damage and debuff abilities make the party yearn for a return to the brillance of the light. The light raising above 49 will cause the party to bask in the promise of safety. Increasing their healing received by 25% per stack.

### Abilities

#### Snuff (Defensive Buff)

- Stealth target hero for 2 turn (not usable on yourself)
- Clear mark from the target
- Decrease light by a very large amount
- Increases dodge slightly
- Give 2 stacks of Poised to the party

The Candlemaker completely snuffs out of the light of her candle plunging the party into darkness, but also concealing them.

Snuff is a effective way to get your hero out of harms way. Stealthed units cannot be directly targetted. Be warned: using this ability will drastically decrease your light level, allowing you to take advantage of stacks of Wild your party has, but increases your risk of damage and stress.

#### Boogeymen (Offensive Buff)

- Horrify target hero (3 stress per round / 3 rounds)
- Push them forward 1 rank (resistable)
- Increase target's damage by 60%-90% for 1 turn
- Decrease light
- Granted 1 stack of Poised to the party

"The darkness holds more much that mere trickery, and boogeymen". The Candlemaker uses the light of her candle to cast horrifying shadows sending a party member into a frenzy.

Boogeymen is best used to set up a huge damage turn for your team. Try using it with collect bounty + mark, shadow fade, or stacks of Wild to rain massive damage into the enemy ranks. Beware: this ability can quickly stress out your units if you aren't prepared for it.

#### Embers (Attack / Debuff) (In Development)

- Small damage to enemy units
- Causes enemies hit to take increased damage for 2 rounds, does not stack
- Decreases Light
- Applies 1 stack of Poised per enemy hit

The Candlemaker snips the wick sending insidious embers into the enemy ranks.

Embers is one of only 2 direct attacks that Candlemaker has. The debuff it applies is useful for maximizing the effects of Boogeymen and stacks of Wild. Although it has a low hit chance, each unit hit applies a stack of Poised allow you to setup for a massive healing turn if it hits multiple targets.

#### Eerie Wax (Support Attack)

In development

#### Strike Match (Single Target Heal)

- Heals for 1 damage
- Applies a heal over time for 1-4 damage over 3 rounds
- Increases light
- Grants 1 stack of Wild to the party

"The match is struck". The Candlemaker strikes a match spurning the candle and providing comfort to a memeber of the party.

Strike match is the work horse of Candlemaker's healing. The heals are effective, but take time to do their healing. Make sure to heal proactively and take advantage of Poised stacks to make it even stronger.

#### Blazing Star (Party Heal)

- Heals target for a small amount
- Heal the entire party over time for 2 rounds
- Greatly increases light
- Disable Candlemaker healing for 2 rounds
- Grants 2 stacks of Wild to the party

"A blazing star is born". The Candlemaker fans the flames of the candle making it roar out of control inspring the team to great heights.

Blazing star is a "big moment" heal. Healing the entire party over time when you have many stacks of Poised can turn an entire fight around. Beware: using Blazing star will lock the Candlemaker out of healing for 2 rounds so make sure you'll be able to survive with out it or utilize your other units to help heal.

#### Mere Trickery (Single Target Support Buff) (In Development)

- Transfers horror from the party to the target hero
- Decrease stress from horror by a large amount
- Increase accuracy
- Small increase to virtue chance

"The darkness holds much more than mere trickery". The Candlemaker raises her candle high dispelling the enemies filling the party with comfort and dispelling all the but the most fightening of horrors.

Mere trickery allows you to greatly reduce the effects of horror on your team. It is situational but synergizes well with Boogeymen. The accuracy increase can also help units like Leper and Occultist be more reliable damage dealers in the end game. Be warned: if you let the stress reduction wear off before the horror you might have set your unit up for massive stress, particularly at low light levels
